# Deltarune Themed Ren'Py Template
A Deltarune themed GUI template for the [Ren'Py game engine](https://github.com/renpy/renpy). I made this project because I noticed a lot of people wanting to create their own Deltarune fangames in Ren'Py. The template will include customized menus, text-image support, 2 minigames, and 3 ready to use characters.

Note: This template uses a custom resolution of 960px by 720px. While, I could lie and say that I chose it as an upscaled format of Deltarune's resolution, but really I chose it because [this game](https://derpychocho.itch.io/dating-start) has the same resolution and I liked the way it looked.

# How to Use
> [!WARNING]
> I recommend making a new project with 720 as the height and 960 as the width. Failing to do so will cause unexpected issues with the GUI and its functionality. 

To customize a majority of the template, follow [this link](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/index.html) for the offical Ren'Py documentations. For customizating minigames and text objects, follow [this link](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/cdd.html) for Ren'Py's documentation on Creator-Defined-Displayables.
